Udacity Data Structures and Algorithms Nanodegree

## Description
This repo contains the project work for my DS and A nanodegree.

## Topics covered
- Arrays and linked lists
- Stacks and queues
- Recursion
- Trees, tries
- Binary, depth- and breadth-first search
- Hash maps
- Sorting - heap, quick, merge
- Greedy algorithms
- Divide and conquer
- Graph algorithms
- Dijkstra
- A*
- Dynamic programming
- Huffman coding
- LRU cache

## Dependencies
Not many. The idea was to implement the fundamental data structures from scratch, so we mainly used the Python built-ins.
